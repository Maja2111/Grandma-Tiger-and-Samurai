# Grandma-Tiger-and-Samurai
A game based on scissors, paper, and rock


Plan:

Create a new project directory for the MERN app.
Set up backend with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (though the game logic may not need DB initially, but we can set up the structure).
Set up frontend with React, mobile-first and responsive design.
Implement game logic with the rules: Grandma beats Samurai, Samurai beats Tiger, Tiger beats Grandma.
Implement UI for figure selection, game mode selection (vs computer or 2 players).
Implement controls: mouse for player 1, arrow keys for player 2.
Write comments in German, game text in English.
Create README files: one for implementation plan, one for process documentation.
Install all necessary dependencies.
Dependent files:

Backend: server.js or app.js, package.json
Frontend: React app files (App.js, components)
README.md and a second documentation file
Follow-up steps:
